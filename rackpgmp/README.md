pgme
====

A library for Profile-Guided Meta-Programming, in Racket.

`tests` contains a set of tests and microbenchmarks, which do not
represent real world programs.

`examples` contains a set of examples using the pgmp library.

`make test` will run the test and microbenchmark suite; it might take a
while.

`make examples` will run the examples; it will not take very long.
