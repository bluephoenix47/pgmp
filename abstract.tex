Profile guided optimization is a compiler technique for using sample data
gathered at run-time to later recompile and optimize a program further.  The
profile data can be more accurate than heuristics normally used in a compiler,
and thus can lead to more optimized code. This paper presents a technique for
using source-level profiling information to provide additional optimizations
and provide additional optimizations with a more accurate heuristic.
Additionally, this paper presents a work-flow for using optimizations based on
source-level profiling data with traditional block-level profile guided
optimizations.~\todo{CITE} These techniques are have been implemented and are
in use as part of a high-performance implementation of Scheme.
