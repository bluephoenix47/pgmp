\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}
This section presents several macros that use profiling information to
optimize the expanded code. The first example is
\schemee{exclusive-cond}, which was mentioned in
section~\ref{sec:intro}. The second is a profile directed loop unrolling
example. While loop unrolling can be done with block-level profiling, it
is simple to do as a macro, and avoids the problem of reconstructing
loops from basic-blocks. The final example is a sequence library that is
conditionally represented using a linked-list or a vector, depending on
profile information.
