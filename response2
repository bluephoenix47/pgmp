Review E states that this paper presents a library in Scheme. To be
clear, we do not present a Scheme library in this paper. We present a
general purpose approach to profile-guided meta-programming, including a
description of a system agnostic API in Section 3.  We evaluate this
approach by implementing it in two different systems---Chez Scheme and
Racket (which is not a Scheme, despite similarities)---and
describe and compare the two different implementations in Section 4. Only
our Racket implementation of our approach is a library. The Chez Scheme
implementation of our approach is not a library as it requires changes
to the profiling and runtime systems.

Review E also points out that performance is not being evaluated at all.
We invite the reviewer to to consult our first response. The first three
paragraphs of our first response cover this topic.
