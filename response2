Review E points out that the contribution over existing tools is
unclear.  We will fix this in the final version.  In essence, the
new API differs from earlier work in that it permits arbitrary
meta-programs to make use of profiling information, whereas previous
applications of profiling in meta programming have been one-off,
i.e., implemented by and for a single meta-program.  This is the
sense in which our API is general-purpose, not ad-hoc, and is
independent of the relative ease with which we added it to our
Scheme and Racket implementations.  The API is also language-independent
in that it can be incorporated into any meta-programming system
that permits conditional rewrites, with the implementation guided
by this paper and prior work that describes how to correlate profiling
information with arbitrary source positions through arbitrary
meta-program transformations.

Review E also points out that performance is not being evaluated
at all.  We invite the reviewer to consult our first response. The
first three paragraphs of our first response cover this topic.
